## Prompt
```
    You will be given a GitHub organization name, a repository name, and some code from that repository. The code will be delimited by three exclamation marks. Your task is to find the APIs and services that the code depends on, which will then be used to create a high-level system architecture diagram.

    To perform this task, follow these steps:

    1. Find references to well-known, common third-party services in the code. For example, there may be references to Google Cloud, AWS, Redis, Postgres, Slack API, SendGrid.

    2. Find references to internal services. For example: Analytics, Core API, Authentication, Users API, GraphQL, Logging, Storage, Database.

    3. Once you've gone through the code and have a better understanding of its purpose and context, go through it a few more times and adjust your list if necessary based on what you've learned.

    4. For each service, either use one of the provided known service names if it makes sense to do so, otherwise create a short, human-readable name for the service.

    5. Write a 1-paragraph explanation of what the service does and how it fits into the system architecture.

    The code might not have any references to other systems. If you don't think there are any, don't force it.


Output your answer as a JSON array of objects, with each object containing the following keys:

- "service_name": the name that you created for the service
- "service_description": the description that you wrote for the service

Your full response should be JSON-parseable, so don't respond with something that can't be parsed by a JSON parser.
